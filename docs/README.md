# Project Proposals (PRPs)

This directory contains all Project Proposal (PRP) documents for substantial features, improvements, and multi-step tasks.

## PRP Naming Convention

All PRPs must follow this naming pattern:
```
PRP-XXX-feature-name.md
```

Where:
- `XXX` = Sequential 3-digit number (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- `feature-name` = kebab-case short description of the feature

## Examples

- `PRP-001-user-achievements.md`
- `PRP-002-dark-mode-toggle.md`
- `PRP-003-course-search.md`
- `PRP-004-payment-integration.md`

## PRP Template

The template is located at `/proposals/PRP-TEMPLATE.md`

Always check existing PRPs in this directory to determine the next sequential number before creating a new one.

## Status

Current PRP count: 0
Next PRP number: 001
